## Quick Start Guide

### Build
```bash
# Cloning repo
git clone https://github.com/telemt/telemt 
# Changing Directory to telemt
cd telemt
# Starting Release Build
cargo build --release
# Move to /bin
mv ./target/release/telemt /bin
# Make executable
chmod +x /bin/telemt
# Lets go!
telemt config.toml
```

## How to use?
### Telemt via Systemd
1. Place your config to /etc/telemt.toml
2. Create service on /etc/systemd/system/telemt.service
```bash
[Unit]
Description=Telemt
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/bin
ExecStart=/bin/telemt /etc/telemt.toml
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
3. In Shell type `systemctl start telemt` - it must start with zero exit-code
4. In Shell type `systemctl status telemt` - there you can reach info about current MTProxy status
5. In Shell type `systemctl enable telemt` - then telemt will start with system startup, after the network is up
